# zero

`zero` constructs closed system.


---

```go
type Zero struct {
    Pathless []byte // point of origin
    Universe []byte // closed system
}

func NewZero(circuit string) *Zero
```

`NewZero` executes `pathless.html` as a Go template with `{{.CIRCUIT}}` substituted (baking `circuit` in as `window.circuit`).

---

## `pathless.html` 


`window.pathless` is the point of origin for the universe.

| `cache`             | `Map<string, Promise<Value>>`       | one in-flight/settled fetch per route path; a settled entry is a single `Value`, so every caller of a path shares one fetch, one decode, and one set of blob urls                                                                                                                                       |
| `source(path = '')` | `(string) => Promise<Value>`        | fetches `${window.circuit}/${path}` and reconstructs the single `Value` it frames inline; caches by `path`; failed fetches evict the cache entry. A leaf route is read via `.data`/`.url`; a bundle route via `.inputs`                                                                                 |
| `exec(el, data)`    | `(HTMLElement, Uint8Array) => void` | decodes UTF-8 `data` into a document fragment (`Range#createContextualFragment`) and replaces `el`'s children — this is how a frame's `<style>/markup/<script>` gets injected and (re-)executed                                                                                                         |
| `init()`            | `() => Promise<void>`               | fetches the root route (`''`), whose `Value` is a bundle of `[universe, frames, panels]`; keeps the universe payload, maps each pool's `.children` to raw bytes on `this.frames`/`this.panels`, execs the universe payload into `#universe` (constructing `Universe` with them), then `universe.init()` |

`source` parses a route's one-value frame inline; a private `Pathless.#decode` reads a bundle's child sequence for the `Value` constructor (`.children`), delegating the shared type table to `Pathless.#typeTable`. Frames never touch the wire — they read `.data`/`.url`/`.children`.

`window.circuit` is set from the templated `{{.CIRCUIT}}`, with `localhost` swapped for the page's actual hostname — so the same compiled shell works when accessed via a LAN IP or a tunnel in dev.

### wire format — `#decode` and `#typeTable`

A route is served as one value frame (parsed inline by `source`); a bundle's children are a nested sequence:

```
route frame:       [1B typeLen][type][payload]           // one Value (a route)

#typeTable(bytes): [1B tableCount]
                   tableCount × [1B typeLen][type]        // string table: MIME types

#decode(bytes):    <type table, via #typeTable>
                   [1B entryCount]
                   entryCount × [1B tableIndex]?[4B dataLen BE][data]   // index omitted when tableCount == 1
```

`source` reads a route's frame inline — a type, then the payload (the rest of the buffer) — and builds one `Pathless.#Value`. `#decode` reads a bundle's `payload`: it delegates the shared type table to `#typeTable` (which returns the parsed types and the offset where entries begin), then reads one length-prefixed entry per child, each becoming a `#Value`. An entry typed `application/x-bundle` carries a further sequence as its `data`; the `Value` constructor decodes it into `children` (see below). `entryCount` lets the result array be allocated at its exact size up front, matching the wire format described in [mechanics.md](../mechanics.md#wire-format).

### `Value` (private, `Pathless.#Value`)

```js
{ type: string, data?: Uint8Array, children?: Value[], get url(): string }
```

A faithful mirror of `fx.Value`: a **leaf** holds its raw bytes in `data`; a **bundle** (`application/x-bundle`) holds its decoded child `Value`s in `children`. The constructor decides by `type` — a bundle's payload is one wire level, decoded into `children` right there via `#decode`; a leaf just keeps `data`. The type travels in-band, so a `Value` is self-describing and the transport `Content-Type` is irrelevant.

- `url` — a `blob:` object URL (`URL.createObjectURL`) for a leaf you render (an image, etc.), memoized on first access; never computed for entries only read as bytes (e.g. JSON).
- `children` — the per-file `Value`s of a bundle; server-side this is `fx.Value.Children`. Because a route's `Value` is cached per path, a bundle reused across spaces yields the same child `Value`s (and thus the same `url`s).

The node's `type` tells you which side applies, exactly as it does server-side (`Data` xor `Children`).

### Boot sequence

```
DOMContentLoaded
  → new Pathless()               // constructs cache, calls init()
    → source('')                 // fetch the root route → one bundle Value
      → root.children            // [universe, frames, panels]
    → exec(#universe, universe.data)    // injects & runs universe.html's script
      → new Universe(pathless, pathless.frames, pathless.panels)
    → universe.init()                   // renders layout 0
```

`exec` running `universe.html`'s script is what defines `Universe`/`Input`/`Panel` and attaches `pathless.universe`, `pathless.input`, `pathless.universe.panel` — this only happens after the root fetch resolves, so nothing here exists until the wire round-trip completes once.

---

## `universe.html` — layout, state, input

Markup: three space containers (`#zero`, `#fx`, `#one`) — `fx` and `one` start `hidden`. Script wraps everything in a block (`{ ... }`) so re-injection via `exec` never redeclares.

### `Universe`

Owns the three spaces, the frame pool, per-(frame, space) state, and layout/navigation.

### `Input`

Resolves pointer and keyboard events into one event model, shared by touch and physical keys.

### `Panel`

A single hidden strip (`#panel`) below the universe, independent of the three spaces.

### Wiring

At the end of the script:

```js
pathless.universe = new Universe(pathless, pathless.frames, pathless.panels);
pathless.input = new Input(pathless);
pathless.universe.panel = new Panel(pathless);
```

`Panel` is attached as `universe.panel` (not `pathless.panel`) — every reference elsewhere (`Input.dispatch`, `Universe.init`) goes through `pathless.universe.panel`.
